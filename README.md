# CHEM-C142
Machine Learning, Statistical Models, and Optimization for Molecular Problems (Spring 2024)

An introduction and current advances in machine learning for the physical sciences. Machine learning prerequisites are introduced including local and global optimization, various statistical and clustering models, and early meta-heuristic methods such as genetic algorithms and artificial neural networks. Building on this foundation, recent machine learning techniques are covered including: deep learning artificial neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent and long short term memory (LSTM) networks, graph neural networks, generative networks, decision trees, Seq2Seq. Various case studies in applying optimization, statistical modeling, and machine learning methods as classification and regression tasks in different areas of (bio)chemistry including enzymology, synthesis, physical property prediction, and automated energy and force generation for molecular dynamics will be covered, including AlphaFold2. A finals project defined by research interest for graduate students and/or projects for undergraduates will be offered.
